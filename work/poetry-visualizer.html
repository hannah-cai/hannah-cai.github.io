                                    import corpus (I was using a small corpus I created of a few favorite songs and poems)</li>

                                <p>*The CMU pronouncing dictionary is a literal {dictionary}, so I had to manually find and fix pronounciations of words that weren't included. Additionally, I needed to break words into syllables, but couldn't find any packages for it, so I used a hyphenation package instead. This also resulted in a lot of errors I had to manually fix (hyphenation doesn't break words into their smallest syllables, in order to preserve legibility).</p>

                            <h3>Due to time and not being very familiar with basil, I wasn't able to try implementing many of the more complex visualizations I had sketched, so that's something I can definitely keep exploring. Additionally, my original plan was to create a book of visualizations; I might follow through with that that in the future, especially since I've learned how to hand bind books. 
                                <br><br>Iâ€™d also love to expand this into a standalone website, with options for user input and interactivity. However, in order to do that, Iâ€™d first have to making the code much more robust, which would probably involve exploring APIs and other methods for parsing pronunciations and syllables. Since I'm still a beginner to coding, I probably won't try anything that ambitious unless I collaborate with someone else.
                                <br><br>Overall, even though I struggled and ran into a lot of unforseen issues, I enjoyed this project and learned a lot! Visualizing poetry is a niche that hasn't really been filled yet, and I'd love to explore it more, whether manually or programmatically.</h3>
