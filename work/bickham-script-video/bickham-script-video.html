        <main style="padding-bottom: 0"><p class="prompt">Create a two-page spread that introduces the reader to the typeface you were assigned. Incorporate at least one image, but no more than three (make sure to include image credits). All text must be legible; clarity, communication and readability is your goal. Consider the use of running headers and/or footers and page folios.</p></main>

            <h2>1—storyboarding</h2>
            I started off by sketching storyboards of what I wanted my narrative to be like. I sketched these on paper, color coding my notes: grey text would be in Bickham Script, black text would be Garamond (I chose to continue using Garamond as my body text, so that it was consistent with my spread), and yellow text is notes about animations I wanted.
            <p>In terms of content, my narrative is pretty similar to what I have on my spread, but it focuses most on the unique history of the typeface, with one designer falling in love with a type of script from centuries ago.</p>

            <h2>2—digital storyboards</h2>
            After I did these sketches, I tried jumping right into After Effects, but found that I wasn’t familiar enough with the program to really do what I wanted to. I also hadn’t really explored what my ideas would look like on screen, so taking my professor and her TA's advice, I did some digital storyboards:

        <main style="padding-top: 50px">Most of these storyboards were just initial ideas or variations of things I was thinking about including. I ended up referencing them for my video, but didn’t actually use most of them.</main>

        <main>
            <h2>4—audio</h2>
            I spent a lot of time deciding on the audio for my video. Based on the personality and context of Bickham Script, I almost immediately knew I wanted something classical or instrumental. I looked through both my own music and Spotify’s “mood playlists,” then complied all the songs I thought might work (shown on the left). I tried cutting them into 60-seconds to see what they’d sound like, and then narrowed down choices from there. I ended up picking Naive Spin because it already had some phrases that I felt like matched transitions I wanted to have in my narrative (eg. “fell in love” transitions to a sweeter, softer melody, etc), and because it had a relatively simple and clear melody.</main>

        <main>
            <h2>5—after effects</h2>
            I was initially planning to use a lot of swash animations in my video, but I hadn’t know how hard and time-consuming it was to create that effect. So instead, I mostly used fading effects, or just popped the words in when there were more piercing notes or melodies. I ended up having to pop in a lot of words near the end to maintain the synchronization I wanted with the music, but I think it worked out ok because it matched the drama of the music and the revealing of the typeface.
            <p>Though I referenced my narrative, I mostly built my animation off of the music. Almost every motion is synced with the music in some way. This provided a good framework for me, but was also limiting at times. However, I’m glad that I chose that route, because the music and text ground each other and naturally flow together, which I think made a more pleasing end product.</p>

            <h2>6—final</h2>
            In general, I had a lot of inhibitions about using a slower song, as well as just having such a different vibe from most of the other videos in my class, which were mostly upbeat and cheerful. I actually had a moment in the middle of working where I was really unhappy with the way my video was going, and I genuinely considered just changing my song and starting over. I think that I was able to appreciate my video more after I saw it during the final crit with everyone else’s. In the end, I still feel like all the work I put into it was worth it.
