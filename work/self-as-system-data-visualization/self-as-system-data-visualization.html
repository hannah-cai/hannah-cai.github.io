Try to convey the information in the clearest and most appealing way possible. Think about how to show connections between different points of data.</p></section>

            <p class="processheader">Scales/Lenses</p>
            <section style="padding-bottom: 0">
                Our first step was to choose our scales and lenses from the lists we were given. For scales, we had to pick steps that weren't too close, but also weren't too far apart; we had to have "individual" as the smallest scale, but but weren't limited for the other ones. For lenses, we had to pick topics that were most relevant to our individual (who we were free to choose, but had to be someone we knew who we could interview). For simplicity, me and my partner Julia decided to use map me, since more of the lenses were applicable to me, and we could easily map out information together, as opposed to interviewing someone else.</section>

            <p class="processheader">Sketching</p>
            <section>
                We started mapping and sketching out information and possible structures we could use. Given the complicated nature of our data, we decided to use a circle separated into five sections to organize our information. We also started thinking about how to relate data points to each other, either by linking bubbles or overlapping them.</section>

            <p class="processheader">Illustrator</p>
            <section>
                After establishing our structure, we started filling out information in Illustrator. Julia did most of the work here.</section>
            <div class="row"> 
                <div class="column2">
                    <img src="p1.png">

            <p class="processheader">Refinement</p>
            <section>
                I added more data and refined the overall look. Instead of using lines or blocks to connect related sections, I decided to use blending instead. This helped the data feel more cohesive, and also made the poster more eye-catching.</section>

            <p class="processheader">Final</p>
            <section>
                The final deliverable; the colors are dimmer because we had to convert the colors from RGB to CMYK for printing. Julia added the key and title, and we wrote the description text together.
