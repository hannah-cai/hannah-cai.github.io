            <p class="processheader">Location</p>
            <section>
                <p>After visiting all three of the possible locations, we decided to choose Wean and Doherty. We didn't want to choose Cyert Hall because it's very isolated and unused, and we were concerned about how much data we'd be able to collect from users; additionally, both of the passageways we explored were unclear and seemed unecessary. We  also decided against Margaret Morrison, because we felt that it might be too complex (4 floors and multiple departments), and because we already had biases about the space due to prior knowledge. In comparison to the other two alternatives, Wean/Doherty seemed like a happy medium, and also seemed like the location with the most need for an intervention.</p><br>
                Some context: Wean and Doherty are two buildings on campus. There are little-known passageways between the buildings, which often go unused because they're hard to find and confusing to navigate. Our goal with the wayfinding project was to make the passageways both easier to find and easier to navigate.</section>

            <section>
                We weren't sure what angle to take at first for our research, but we eventually decided on two questions: where are most people headed, and how hard is it to find the connection? To answer these questions, we placed two posters in the connection (one one Wean's side, and one on Doherty's side) and asked users both to record where they were headed and to rate how hard it was to navigate the connection the first time they took it.</section>

                <div class="column"></div>

                We received 75 responses total: 47 entering Doherty, and 32 entering Wean. After weeding out answers that weren't descriptive enough to be useful (eg. "Home"), we broke down the data into this chart.</section>

            <section class="center" style="padding-top: 50px">
                Our main takeaways were that Doherty got the most votes for "difficult to navigate," suggesting that it's harder for users to navigate than Wean. This makes sense, since the layout of Wean is pretty much the same from floor to floor, while Doherty's floors have a lot of variation.</section>
            <section class="center" style="padding-top: 50px">
                We also sent out a google survey, receiving 68 responses. Some key questions and answers:</section>

            <section class="center" style="padding-top: 50px">
                Finally, to get well-rounded data, we also conducted guerilla interviews of people around the passageway. Here are some of the things we heard the most:</section>

                Major takeaways from our research:
                <ol>
                    <li>Around half of the users of the passageways find them difficult to navigate.</li>
                    <li>Most of the users are freshmen, indicating an even greater need for an intervention, since freshmen likely have very little knowledge of the campus.</li>
                    <li>The biggest source of confusion surrounding the passageway is how Wean and Doherty's floors don't line up (eg. Doherty's basement A leads to Wean's 5th floor, which is also the ground floor).</li>
                    <li>Users find Doherty harder to navigate than Wean.</li>
                    <li>Most users preferred traditional signage or signage on the floor as an intervention.</li>

            <p class="processheader">Ideation</p>
            <section>
                Taking what we learned from our data, we started sketching ideas for interventions. Some of our early ideas included a string suspended above head height, signs pointing the way, and an overall map of the area. However, we quickly settled down on the idea of tape as a pathway/guiding mechanism, combined with the use of signs; this idea merged the two most preferred invetervention methods of the users, and seemed clean, efficient, and feasible.</section>

                After settling on this idea, we started prototyping in Illustrator. We decided on the color orange because we felt like it was a neutral but friendly color which stood out well against the walls of both Doherty and Wean.</section>

            <section>
                Since we knew that users struggled more with navigating in Doherty, and since the pathway from Doherty to Wean is physically more complex, we decided to base our intervention mostly in Doherty.</section>

            <p class="processheader">Conclusion</p>
            <section><p>Overall, our project did pretty well—we got very positive feedback, with over 75% of users saying that our intervention was useful, and that they liked it. Almost everyone thought that the intervention would be useful for freshmen next year.</p><br>
                <p>Even though this was my first wayfinding project, I really enjoyed it, and I had a lot of fun working with my group members!</p></section>
