While brainstorming the most time-effective methods for creating an animation, I considered using code (p5.js & WEBGL) as a medium, and made a few tests to see if I could mimic an underwater scene. Though the results were promising, I eventually decided not to use code, since I was worried that my general unfamiliarity with WEBGL would make me lag behind.</h3>

Playing with the idea of showing less, I explored a new visual direction: blurring and colorizing stock footage. This allowed me to work a lot faster than I would've been if I was animating, and also created a unique dream-like aesthetic which worked quite well for my concept. I changed my narrative to a slow fade out of sound and footage, as a metaphor for the extinction of marine species.</h3>
