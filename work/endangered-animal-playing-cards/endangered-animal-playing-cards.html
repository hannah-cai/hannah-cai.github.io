                <p>This project was created for the Adobe Awards Competition for entry into the Social Impact Segment. I decided to design a playing card set based off of threatened (critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable) animal species and subspecies. The species featured in these cards are just a fragment of the amount of species worldwide that are threatened with extinction. I hope that incorporating threatened animal species designs into a common, everyday object—a deck of playing cards—will help spread awareness of how human development, hunting, poaching, and pet trade pose threats to countless animal species.</p>
                <p>Each of the following featured species/subspecies is threatened with extinction. The shape in the background of the card indicates the conservation status of the species/subspecies:</p>
            </section>
            <p class="subtitle" style="padding: 15px">TRIANGLE = CRITICALLY ENDANGERED<br>
                SQUARE = ENDANGERED<br>
                CIRCLE = VULNERABLE</p>
            <section style="padding-bottom: 0">
                <p>This video explains the meaning of each category.</p>
                <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSeekerMedia%2Fvideos%2F10155055177748387%2F&show_text=0&width=476" width="476" height="500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>
                <p>When viewing the cards, pay close attention to the conservation status of each species. Many species that have been spearheads of environmental concern are actually not as threatened as other smaller and less known species, a fact I found both surprising and concerning. Though environmental campaigns are certainly positive, lobbying for a species simply because it is more marketable creates misleading stereotypes that are harmful to other species in greater danger.</p>
                <p>Each card is based closely off of an actual species or subspecies, with differences in color and vector shape reflecting species variation and sexual dimorphism.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <section style="padding-bottom: 0px">
                <p>This was definitely a challenging project. I struggled a lot with not only creating the animal designs themselves, but also creating the card symbols, deciding on typography for the letters and numbers, sectiontaining visual consistency and balance throughout the deck, and making everything look symmetrical and polished.</p>
                <p>My general process began with researching online about threatened species and subspecies. After deciding which four I would do for a particular set of numbers or royals, I then created the designs for the animals using vector shapes from a free vector app called Assembly. After exporting raw images from Assembly, I would import them to Adobe Sketch, where I used the perspective grid as a template for resizing and moving elements in order to create a traditional, diagonally mirrored card design. I then used Adobe Sketch's shape-tracing function to create the geometric background and border of each card. Lastly, I hand-wrote the species (or subspecies) name for each card in Adobe Sketch.</p>
                <p>It's worth noting that I did this project at a time in which I didn't yet have the Adobe Suite. If I was to do this project again now, my process would be very different.</p>
