                        <h3 class="container-m">NOVID was founded in March 2020 by world reknowned mathematician Po-Shen Lo, and launched in April 2020 in the App and Play Store. We currently have over a hundred thousand users, as well as various universities and cities using our community tools.
                            <br><br>I joined NOVID's design team in the summer of 2020 as a specialist in motion and visual design. My other two team members are Bennett Huffman, who specializes in UI/UX and web development; and Dean Dijour, who specializes in UI/UX and also leads Android development. I started out by creating onboarding animations, but later branched out to do a little bit of everything, from rehauling the design system to redesigning some in-app flows.</h3>

Bennett and I benchmarked various COVID surveys to determine the flow and content. This feature is currently being developed.</h3>

                            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                            <h3>NOVID is the most extensive project I've worked on, and I'm so glad that I get to work with such an amazing team on something that has the potential to really help people. I've learned a lot about UI/UX, design systems, working with developers, and accessibility, and really enjoyed working with other designers on a real, live product.
                                <br><br>That being said, there are definitely things I wish I and the team could focuse more on. Since NOVID is a small startup with few people, we move fast and are often stretched thin. This usually means that we have no time for any user testing more in-depth than sending quick polls in Slack. Additionally, although we track some clicks and user activity, we don't have a concrete system of measuring of if our features/designs actually upped user retention or interest. I haven't had much experience with either working with user testing or using statistics as a heuristic for design, but I feel like both are important parts of design in industry; I hope to be able to learn more about both in future positions.</h3>
